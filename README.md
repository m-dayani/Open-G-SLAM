# Open-G-SLAM
A general repository to combine SLAM methods, fuse sensors, etc.

The goal of this project is to build a flexible SLAM system.
Objectives:
  - Fusing different sensors
  - Combining different techniques: graph-based SLAM, KLT optical flow, filtering methods, direct/indirect, deep learning, ...
  - Redefinition of concepts: Pose, Map, Connections, ...
  - Flexible enough to build a cheep tracker with an IMU, or a complicated system with Cameras, Range-finders, ...
